1. **Classes and Objects Analogy**:
    - **Accounts as Objects**: In the context of a safe, each account can be thought of as an object. These objects (accounts) inherit their access control parameters from the safe (the class).
    - **Creating a New Safe**: Creating a new safe is akin to defining a new class. This new class will have its own set of parameters and rules, different from the original class.
2. **Implementing OLAC**:
    - **Granular Control**: Enabling OLAC is similar to creating specialized classes with unique parameters. It allows for detailed and specific access controls for each account (object) within the safe (class).
    - **Flexibility and Complexity**: With OLAC, each account can have its own set of permissions, offering greater flexibility but also adding complexity to the management of these accounts.
3. **Irreversibility and Data Integrity**:
    - **Changing Class Structure**: Once a safe has been converted to use OLAC, it's like splitting a single class into multiple classes with different parameters. This change is typically irreversible without potential data loss or integrity issues.
    - **Data Integrity Concerns**: Reverting back to a single class (or safe without OLAC) would mean trying to merge these varied parameters into one, which can lead to conflicts and loss of specific access control settings.
4. **Management and Administration**:
    - **Administrative Overhead**: Managing multiple safes with OLAC can be more labor-intensive. It requires careful planning and consistent monitoring to ensure proper access controls are maintained.
    - **Audit and Compliance**: With OLAC, auditing and compliance checks can become more detailed, as each account needs to be individually checked for proper access settings.
5. **Best Practices**:
    - **Proper Planning**: Before enabling OLAC, it's crucial to have a clear plan on how the accounts will be organized and what access each account will require.
    - **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and update the access controls for each account to ensure they align with current needs and security policies.
    - **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of the access settings for each account for auditing purposes and to simplify future management.
6. **Alternatives to OLAC**:
    - **Grouping Similar Accounts**: As an alternative to OLAC, similar accounts can be grouped in safes with similar access requirements, reducing the complexity of managing individual account permissions.

In summary, enabling OLAC for accounts within a safe offers granular control at the cost of increased complexity and management overhead. The analogy of classes and objects helps illustrate the structural changes and considerations involved in this process.
