Yes, DEP stands for Data Execution Prevention. It's a security feature available in modern operating systems. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Purpose**: DEP is designed to help prevent certain types of malicious attacks by not allowing code to execute from regions of memory that are marked as non-executable. This means that even if malicious code finds its way onto a system and attempts to execute from what is typically a data-only region, DEP will help prevent it.

2. **How it Works**: At the hardware level, DEP uses the CPU's NX (No eXecute) or XD (eXecute Disable) bit to mark certain areas of memory as non-executable. When code attempts to run from these regions, the hardware raises an exception. At the software level, the operating system can catch this exception and take the appropriate action, typically terminating the offending process.

3. **Configurability**: While DEP is enabled by default for certain core system processes and services, users and administrators can typically configure DEP for additional applications if they choose. There are also options to turn off DEP for specific applications that might have compatibility issues with this protection mechanism.

4. **Limitations**: DEP isn't a silver bullet. While it provides an additional layer of defense against certain types of attacks, it doesn't replace the need for other security measures, such as antimalware software, firewalls, and safe computing practices.

5. **Compatibility Issues**: Some older software may not be compatible with DEP, and attempting to run such software with DEP enabled might result in the software failing to execute or crashing. In such cases, DEP can often be selectively disabled for those specific applications.

Always remember that while features like DEP enhance security, no single mechanism can provide complete protection. Layered security approaches, combining both hardware and software defenses, alongside user awareness, are always recommended.

### Network Level Authentication

Network Level Authentication (NLA) is a security feature introduced in later versions of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) used by Remote Desktop Services. It plays a crucial role in providing an additional layer of authentication before a session is established. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

1. **Role in Remote Desktop Connection**:
    - **Early Authentication**: Before NLA, RDP would set up a session before authenticating the user. With NLA, the system authenticates the user before fully establishing a session. This helps in reducing the resource overhead on the remote machine for unauthorized or malicious access attempts.
    - **Protection Against Denial of Service (DoS) and Brute-force Attacks**: By forcing pre-session authentication, NLA can prevent malicious users from opening numerous sessions or trying to brute-force passwords by attempting multiple connections.

2. **How it Works**:
    - NLA leverages the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol to perform strong client-side authentication.
    - The user's credentials are checked before the full Remote Desktop Connection is established, which means that no session is set up until the user is authenticated.

3. **Requirements**:
    - **Client Requirements**: To utilize NLA, you need an RDP client that supports it. Windows Vista and later versions have built-in RDP clients that support NLA.
    - **Server Requirements**: The Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) must run Windows Vista or a later version to support NLA.

4. **Benefits**:
    - **Enhanced Security**: Offers an additional layer of protection before a session is even established.
    - **Reduced Attack Surface**: Malicious users can't interact with the RDSH (or the login screen) directly without first passing NLA.

5. **Potential Drawbacks**:
    - **Compatibility**: Older clients that don't support NLA won't be able to connect unless NLA is disabled on the server.
    - **User Experience**: If there are issues with NLA, users might experience problems or delays when trying to establish a connection.

6. **Configuration**:
    - You can enable or disable NLA via the Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration tool or through Group Policy settings.

In a security-conscious environment, it's generally recommended to keep NLA enabled, as it provides an additional layer of protection for remote connections. However, if you have older devices or software that need to connect and don't support NLA, you'll need to weigh the risks and benefits of disabling it.

### `Set-ExecutionPolicy`

In PowerShell, `Set-ExecutionPolicy` is a cmdlet used to define the level of security surrounding the execution of PowerShell scripts on a system. It dictates how (or if) PowerShell scripts (.ps1 files) are run to ensure that you don't inadvertently execute malicious scripts.

The primary purpose of the execution policy isn't to prevent malicious activity, but to act as a safety feature that helps prevent users from unknowingly running scripts. Here are the common execution policy levels:

1. **Restricted** (default): Does not allow any scripts to run, regardless of where they came from.

2. **AllSigned**: Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.

3. **RemoteSigned**: Any PowerShell scripts that have been locally created can be run. However, scripts downloaded from the internet (or received via email, for instance) need to be signed by a trusted publisher.

4. **Unrestricted**: Any script can be run, regardless of where it came from or whether it's signed. This setting obviously poses a risk and is not recommended for most situations.

5. **Bypass**: Nothing is blocked and no warnings, prompts, or messages are shown. It's even less secure than "Unrestricted" and should be used with great caution.

6. **Undefined**: Removes the currently assigned execution policy from the current scope. This means it will fall back to whatever the execution policy is defined at a wider scope.

The policy can be set at different levels, or scopes:

- **Process**: Affects only the current PowerShell session.
- **CurrentUser**: Affects only the current user.
- **LocalMachine**: Affects all users on the current computer.
- **UserPolicy**: Set by Group Policy for the user configuration.
- **MachinePolicy**: Set by Group Policy for the computer configuration.

To change the execution policy, an administrator will typically run a command like:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This would set the execution policy to "RemoteSigned" for the entire system. If you wanted to set it just for the current user, you'd use:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Always be cautious when changing the execution policy, and only set it to as permissive a level as you genuinely need.

### Domain Joined Server

A "domain-joined" server (or computer) refers to a server (or any computer system) that has been registered and authenticated to a domain within a network that uses Microsoft's Active Directory service. When a server or computer is domain-joined, it becomes a member of that domain and adopts its security and policy settings.

Here are some key points and benefits associated with domain-joined servers or computers:

1. **Centralized Management**: One of the most significant benefits of domain-joining servers and computers is centralized management. IT administrators can manage policies, push updates, and enforce security settings to all domain-joined machines from a single central point, which is typically a server running Active Directory.

2. **Security and Authentication**: In a domain environment, users don't authenticate against individual computers. Instead, they authenticate against the domain, which checks credentials stored in Active Directory. This means a user can log into any domain-joined machine using their domain credentials.

3. **Group Policies**: Active Directory allows administrators to define Group Policies (GPOs) that dictate how computers and users within the domain behave. This could include settings like password complexity requirements, software deployment, or specific user interface customizations.

4. **Resource Access**: Being part of a domain facilitates easier sharing of resources like files and printers. Permissions for accessing these resources are managed centrally.

5. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Once a user logs into a domain-joined machine, they can often access other resources within the network (like shared folders, printers, or intranet sites) without being prompted to log in again, as they've already been authenticated against the domain.

6. **Scalability**: As organizations grow, the ability to manage and deploy settings or software to thousands of machines becomes crucial. A domain environment allows for this scalability.

7. **Trust Relationships**: Domains can have trust relationships with other domains, which means users from one domain can be granted access to resources in another trusted domain.

A domain-joined server is essentially one that has been configured to operate within these domain structures, leveraging the benefits of centralized management, security, and resource access that come with being a member of an Active Directory domain.

- Reason for access
- Dual control
- Exclusive Passwords

## Doubts

What happens when the [[Administrator]] user is given instead of the domain user at the execute-step1 stage? is it going to work? will it throw an error later?
