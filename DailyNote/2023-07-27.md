- Understood fundamental idea of what CyberArk is, like it made sense in my head. The idea of user and account are based on the context. If a person is accessing an account he is the user and the account is the access to that target server.
	- I am still unable to explain it well using words but I did get the idea and now I can relate things better. Its a great improvement.
	- I am missing a crucial point in the idea. The end user needs to access ta a certain account created by the vault admin, to do this the end user has to be added to a safe and allowed to access the accounts he needs to.
