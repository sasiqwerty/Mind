## Topics Discussed
### Enforce check-in/check-out exclusive access
 
Use this rule to ensure that only one user will be able to access and use an account at any given point of time. When a user checks out an account, it is locked and cannot be retrieved by other users. Other users can only check out the same account after the first user has checked the account back in. To achieve automatic release of locked passwords and full personal accountability, enable this and the “Enforce one-time password access” rule together. If a user doesn't check the account in manually within a predefined timeframe, the CPM will check it in automatically. This timeframe is determined by the 'Minimum timeframe that a password is available after retrieval' platform setting or by the timeframe defined in the dual control request.

 The term _check-in_ describes the process of adding a new or modified item or file to a document library or a list to replace the previous version. The term _check-out_ describes the process of getting a version of a document or list item in a list or library. By checking out an item or a file, a user can prevent others from editing that content. By checking in the item, the user can allow others to edit the content, without needing to worry about overriding changes that others have made.
 
### Enforce one-time password access
 
Use this rule to ensure that passwords are changed after each access. When a user retrieves an account, the CPM initiates a password change process that will occur automatically after a predefined timeframe. In contrast to the 'Enforce check-in/check-out exclusive access' rule, multiple users can access the same password simultaneously. To achieve personal accountability, enable this rule and the 'Enforce check-in/check-out exclusive access' rule together. The timeframe that an account will be available before it will be automatically changed is determined by the 'Minimum timeframe that a password is available after retrieval' platform setting or by the timeframe defined in the dual control request.

ask for this file? check if you have this file.
## Notes

- *Enforcing the one time password access rule ensures that once the account is accessed the password is rotated.*
- Account is locked when the user check outs a certain account, only after the check in of the account the another user can access the said account.
- Is it wrong to use verbal nods? ah ah ah ? have to ask about this. I felt that it makes the conversation less professional. If that's the case maybe you just don't do it.
