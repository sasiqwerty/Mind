## Study Topics

## What's on Your Mind?

### What is the Problem?

the problem of plenty. I am not interested in anything right now. Why am I not afraid of anything? I need to taste something before I lose it. I have no fear. I am good and I am not afraid of things going wrong or blowing up in my face. 

Lets think of a plan where I can live my happy life for an year without a problem. Lets see how much money that would take. This is a a good idea as having an exit strategy is a good idea.

I need to calculate how much money I need to live for an year and see how to make it. I might need 30k a month, so I have to save up to 3.6L. I seems like a good amount.
- in the first job I want to get 70k to 90k.
- I should ask myself : Do I really need to buy a bike?
- What are responsibilities 

### Extract

I had a real bad headache in the night, waking up was better. I want to be able to sleep. I am not afraid of anything as of now. I am feeling too numb. Drinking tea helped me a bit. I am thinking of quitting smoking. It has to be done gradually. My heart or the region around the heart is not feeling so good, it has something to do with the lack of exercise. I have this constant headache that is mostly due to lack of sleep, alot of my problems come from the inability for me to allow myself to feel something. I stop the feeling as soon as I feel something.

I have gained weight, it started to bother me. I have to do something about it.

I remember crying about losing love in my life, how I stopped feelings things and eventually I started feeling numb.

I rarely feel happy or sad. I am blocking out the pain, it also blocks the feeling of happiness. I need someone to make me feel something to unlock my parts that make me feel sad and happy. I say to mom that I am not feeling myself. I dont feel myself with people around me and she says that its the case for everyone. Most people dont get what they want, I do agree in that aspect but its not that. In the process of preventing heartache I stopped my emotions. That stopped me from feeling everything else, my sister thinks its not possible. I am a living example of how we condition ourselves to do things just like this. 

I feel like writing what's comes to my mind is helping me understand what's going on in my mind. I am going to wait for a bit before I take anymore decisions. 

I dont have the words to say about what are feelings?

Depending on family, 

Thinking in a certain way is giving me a headache.

### Solutions ?

Our body has urges, wants and wills. We tend to follow them as a pattern, in a routine. Things start to break when the routine is not healthy, when its not safe for the host system. I need to understand my routine, the parts that are destroying me. My problems.  
I need to keep tabs on my progress from now on. I dont know what I am doing. 

_Based on the text you provided, the concise list of problems mentioned are:_

1. Emotional numbness.
2. Difficulty in feeling both happiness and sadness.
