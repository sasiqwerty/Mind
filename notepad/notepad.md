1. **New Spectre Ultimate**: You find the new Spectre (Spec) ultimate ability to be amazing, particularly because of its 40-second cooldown.  
    - ðŸ¤” **Thoughts**: A 40-second ultimate ability on Spectre sounds incredibly powerful. This would provide more frequent opportunities for global presence and damage. It might even tip the scales towards being overpowered, depending on other balancing factors.
2. **Bristleback's Aghanim's Scepter**: You're curious to try out Bristleback's (BB) new Aghanim's Scepter, which you describe as "quills spewing madness".  
    - ðŸ¤” **Thoughts**: Bristleback with Aghanim's Scepter upgrades has historically been a formidable force in team fights. The new upgrade could potentially make him even more menacing, depending on its exact mechanics.
3. **Game Difficulty with New Spec**: You felt that the game was too easy with the new Spectre and questioned if the hero is "busted".
    - ðŸ¤” **Thoughts**: If the game feels much easier when playing as Spectre, that could indicate a balance issue that might require adjustments from the developers.

### Grand Turismo 2023 Movie

1. **Break Glazing in Racing:** I was reading about "brake glazing." It's a phenomenon in racing where the brakes get too hot, causing a glazed surface on the brake pads. This reduces their effectiveness and can lead to overheating issues in racing cars.
