## Recruiting round

**Reason for Seeking Change:**
- I am currently working on a payroll basis and not as a full-time employee. I am actively seeking a full-time opportunity to further my career.
- My payroll partner provided me with the necessary training.

**Notice Period:**
- I am currently serving my notice period, which is set to conclude at the end of December.

**Financial and Administrative Details:**
- I have an active PF account and can provide my UAN number as required. ( Anji said you were recently changed to permanent employee so you can provide the needed documents)
- My current salary is 6.3 LPA.
- For my next role, I am expecting a salary of around 10 LPA.

**Buy-Out Option:**
- Regarding the buy-out option, I need to have a discussion with my current reporting manager to understand the possibilities and terms.

**Interview Availability:**
- I am available for interviews preferably before lunch, as my afternoons are typically occupied with client calls. This scheduling makes me appear committed and engaged in my current role.

**Work Preference (Onsite/Hybrid):**
- In terms of work location, I am looking for a hybrid arrangement. I am willing and able to come to the office as part of such a setup.

**Professional Profile Overview:**
- After my training, I was placed with Cyient by VIRVI. In this role, I have had the opportunity to work with various clients, gaining valuable experience and insights into the industry.
