Help me plan a MCQ like question pattern for flash card style app in JavaScript HTML% and CSS, the file with input (the questions and its options as answers) would be in csv format. 

- The app should contain a counter for the right and wrong question
- the app should display the wrong questions in the end of the quiz
- the app should be able to ask the user for the length of the quiz
- the app should contain the option to only practice the wrong answers entered in the session
