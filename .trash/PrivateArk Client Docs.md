## Introducing the Cyber-Ark Vault

The PrivateArk Client interface enables authorized users to access information stored inside the Cyber-Ark Vault. 

This section introduces you to the PrivateArk Client and its concepts. It includes the following topics:

- An introduction to the Cyber-Ark Vault 
- A list of ways in which the Vault protects your data

 

The Cyber-Ark Vault is a state-of-the-art system that enables you to share information securely. It is used to share sensitive information such as credit card numbers, contracts, and so on. This information is completely secure while stored inside a Vault and during transmission over the network, and is accessible to authorized users via a local network and over the Internet. 

How does the Cyber-Ark Vault protect your files so effectively? Think of a network as having a many borders that make it easy to attack. The Cyber-Ark Vault puts your information in a small area of the network so that it’s easier to defend. 

The area where your information is stored on the network is called the Vault. In order to work with a file that is stored in the Vault, you take it out. You return the file when you’re finished. That’s the basic principle behind working with files. The files in the Vault can’t be opened until they’re taken out of the Vault and placed on your computer. The PrivateArk Client is the interface through which you can enter the Vault and access the information within.

### The Value of the Vault in Your Organization

When you log onto the PrivateArk Client, you’ll see one or more Vaults on your screen. For example, let's say you can see two Vaults; one containing files which are internal for a company, and one containing information to share with customers. The Company Vault containing internal information can only be opened by the Managing Director and other selected employees at the company, as defined in the PrivateArk Client. The Customers Vault, containing information for external contacts, can be accessed by particular employees and by specified customers. In the same way as you need a key to open a real Vault, users who require access to the contents of the Vault need an electronic “key” or password. 

Inside the Vault is a storage unit called a Safe. The Safe contains files related to particular subjects. For instance, a Safe can be created in order to store information related to Human Resources. The Safe would contain information such as personnel specifications, contracts, salaries, employee option offers, and other similar records.

There may, in fact, be several Safes inside a Vault; a Safe for financial information, a Safe for engineering projects, a Safe for marketing details, a Safe for research documents, and a Safe for management files. Each of these Safes is shared with managers and employees, at the decision of the Safe Supervisor. The financial Safe, for instance, is shared by a manager, payroll staff, accountants, lawyers, and financial analysts. 

Each User, however, has different levels of access to the Safe. For instance, an external financial analyst may be able to access the company’s Financial Safe in order to retrieve and store modify files, but not modify or delete them. Assigning different authorizations enables you to share files, while still maintaining a secure environment. 

The Vault also contains a surveillance system that is used to monitor Users. Similar to video cameras that record activity in a bank, all activity that takes place in the Vault is recorded. These records can be used to monitor Users’ actions. There is also an electronic watch dog that "barks" or alerts you of activity the moment it occurs. 

Using Safes on a Day-to-Day Basis  
The PrivateArk Client lets you control who has access to the Safes. It also lets you control how the files in the Safe are used. This ability to manage the files lets you maintain control over the files while still sharing them in a secure environment. 

The following three scenarios show how useful the Cyber-Ark Vault is to organizations that need to share information securely in a local network, among remote branches, between business partners, and with customers all of who need different degrees of access to information.

### How the Vault Protects Your Files

Information that is stored in the Safe is protected in a variety of ways: 

Various Logon Options - The Vault cannot be entered without a password and/or key.  
Timing restrictions - You can limit the times during which the Vaults/Safes can be opened (e.g., 8 am to 5 pm).  
Protected network areas - You can determine the locations on the network from which your Vault is accessed. This process is called defining a Private Network Area. For instance, an employee at an international company can set a Private Network Area so that their User account is only available from the Boston branch where he resides.  
Safe Authorizations - You can define the level of access to a Safe for other Users. For instance, you can authorize Users to work with files but not to delete them.  
Marked files - Files are marked each time they are handled. This information keeps you updated about all file activity.  
Electronic watch dog - An electronic watch dog barks to alert you each time there is activity in the Vault.  
Version control - The Cyber-Ark Vault tracks versions of the files it stores. Every time a file is updated, a new version is created. This means that if the most recent version of a document is corrupted, previous versions are still available. In addition, you can undelete files that have been previously deleted.  
Confirmation - Users may need to receive permission from other Users in order to open a Safe. For example, before another User can access a Safe they may need to request your permission and request confirmation.  
Inspecting Activity - The Cyber-Ark Vault keeps records of all activities that take place inside it. This information is divided into Safe History and User History. An alert appears each time there is illegal activity in the Vault. For instance, an alert is issued when an attempt is made to log onto the Vault without the correct password.
