Safes - storage and access location?

1. the safes are stored in the vault.  
2. the safes are accessible from the [[PrivateArk Client]]  
3. the safes are also accessible from [[Password Vault Web Access|PVWA]]
4. safes can contain folders, the main folder is called root.

Accounts are created in the [[Target Server]] while the users are in the [[Active Directory]]  
[[CyberArk]] paves a way to connect these users to the accounts without revealing the passwords.

Who can access the safes?

1. The master user can access every safe in the vault but can only login from the [[PrivateArk Client]] installed from the location of vault install.
2. Other users in [[CyberArk]] can access the vault from both the [[Password Vault Web Access|PVWA]] and the [[PrivateArk Client]]
3. [[Administrator]] has the most privileges after the master user.
4. What are these permissions that these CyberArk users have?
5. where can these permissions be modified?
6. What are the safe authorizations?








> now the question is what happens when the safes are changed in the [[PrivateArk Client]] and not in the [[Password Vault Web Access|PVWA]] is that considered safe? would it cause problems?
