### Roguelike

"Roguelike" is a subgenre of role-playing video games that are characterized by a number of distinct features. The term originated from the game "Rogue," which was released in the early 1980s and showcased many of these features. Over time, the genre has evolved, and while some modern roguelikes may not possess all of the traditional characteristics, they often maintain the core elements.

Here are the key features of roguelike games:

1. **Procedural Generation:** Dungeons, levels, or maps are generated randomly each time a player starts a new game, ensuring a unique experience in each playthrough.

2. **Permadeath:** When a player's character dies, they typically have to start a new game from the beginning. This adds a layer of tension and stakes to the gameplay.

3. **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Traditional roguelikes are turn-based, meaning players take their actions one at a time, and once they've made a move or performed an action, enemies or other game elements take their turns.

4. **Tile-Based Graphics:** Classic roguelikes often have simple graphics based on tiles. In many early roguelikes, the visuals were ASCII characters.

5. **Complex Gameplay:** Roguelikes often feature intricate mechanics and systems, allowing for deep strategy and various approaches to situations.

6. **Resource Management:** Players must manage limited resources, such as health, ammunition, or magic spells, making decision-making crucial.

7. **Character Progression:** As players progress through the game, their character often gets stronger, gaining new abilities, items, or stats. However, once the character dies, this progression is typically lost.

8. **High Difficulty:** Roguelikes are known for their challenging nature, often requiring players to learn from their mistakes and adapt strategies across multiple playthroughs.

The term "roguelike" has seen some evolution and expansion over time, leading to the emergence of terms like "roguelite" and "roguelike-inspired." These terms often refer to games that incorporate some, but not all, of the traditional roguelike elements. Games like "Spelunky," "The Binding of Isaac," and "Dead Cells" can be categorized as roguelites because they mix in real-time action with roguelike elements such as procedural generation and permadeath.

Whether classic roguelikes or their modern evolutions, these games offer players challenging experiences where adaptability, strategy, and learning from failure are essential.

### Roguelite

"Roguelite" is a term that has emerged to describe games that incorporate certain elements characteristic of traditional "roguelike" games but deviate in some significant ways. The term acknowledges that these games are inspired by roguelikes but do not strictly adhere to all their defining features.

Here are some common characteristics of roguelites:

1. **Procedural Generation:** Like roguelikes, roguelites often feature levels or worlds that are procedurally generated, ensuring each playthrough is unique.

2. **Permadeath:** Roguelites typically retain the concept of permadeath, where the player has to start over after dying. However, the punishment might not be as strict as in traditional roguelikes.

3. **Meta Progression:** One of the main deviations from roguelikes is that roguelites often have a form of meta progression. This means that even though players start over after each death, certain upgrades, unlocks, or achievements might carry over between runs. This can give a sense of long-term progression, even in the face of repeated failures.

4. **Diverse Gameplay Styles:** While traditional roguelikes are often turn-based, roguelites can embrace a wide variety of gameplay styles, including platforming, twin-stick shooting, action combat, and more.

5. **More Accessible:** Roguelites often aim for broader appeal, and as such, they might streamline certain mechanics or reduce the overall difficulty to be more accessible to a wider audience.

Popular examples of roguelite games include:

- **"The Binding of Isaac"**: A dungeon crawler where players explore a series of procedurally generated rooms, fighting monsters and collecting power-ups.
  
- **"Spelunky"**: A platformer with procedurally generated caves. Each playthrough challenges players with new layouts and obstacles.
  
- **"Dead Cells"**: An action-platformer that merges metroidvania exploration elements with roguelite progression and procedural generation.

- **"Enter the Gungeon"**: A twin-stick shooter with roguelite elements, where players navigate procedurally generated floors and battle against a variety of enemies.

These games have gained considerable popularity in recent years, with many players appreciating the mix of challenging roguelike elements with more modern game mechanics and designs.
