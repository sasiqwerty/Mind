- Which accounts can be selected for use in the Windows discovery process? (Choose 2)
	- C. the Vault Administrator  
	- E. the PasswordManager user
	- **Explanation** : The CPM Scanner service scans Windows and Unix machines for new and modified accounts and their dependencies. The discovered accounts are displayed in the Pending Accounts feed for review.
- Your organization requires all passwords be rotated every 90 days. Where can you set this requirement?
	- A. Master Policy
	- **Explanation** : The Master Policy offers a centralized overview of the security and compliance policy of privileged accounts in your organization while allowing you to configure compliance driven rules that are defined as the baseline for your enterprise. It is configured out-of-the-box and can be used immediately after implementation, providing an intuitive, simplified user experience and enhanced bottom-line insight for administrators, IT personnel, managers and auditor
- You created a new platform by duplicating the out-of-box Linux through the SSH platform. Without any change, which Text Recorder Type(s) will the new platform support? (Choose 2.) #doubt
	- A. SSH Text Recorder
	- B. Universal Keystrokes Text Recorder
- What is required to Manage loosely connected devices?
	- **B.** EPM
	- CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) enforces least privilege and enables organizations to block and contain attacks on endpoint computers, reducing the risk of information being stolen or encrypted and held for ransom. A combination of privilege security, application control and credential theft prevention reduces the risk of malware infection.
	- One of the challenges in privileged account security is managing privileged accounts on devices that are not often connected to the network. For example, the local built-in administrators on laptops that can be disconnected from the network for long periods of time, making it difficult for the security and operational teams to enforce security policies.
	- PAM - Self-Hosted uses CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) to rotate credentials of accounts on Windows and macOS devices that are not always connected to the enterprise network. These devices are called loosely connected devices.
	- This solution does not manage local accounts with dependencies (usages) or local accounts that belong to an account group.

- Where can reconcile and/or logon accounts be linked to an account? (Choose 2)
	- Account settings
	- Platform settings
	- A platform defines shared characteristics for multiple accounts. It defines the technical settings for these accounts, such as:
		- Account properties
		- Credential management policies and timeframe. For example, how frequently a password will be changed or verified.
		- The rules that must be applied when a new random password is generated. These rules must match the password rules on the remote machine where the password will be used, so that the password will be accepted during the password change operation as well as during log on.
		- Session management. For example, how connection is established.
		- Linked accounts
		- Mail notifications
		- Workflows
- Which dependent accounts does the CPM support out-of-the-box?
	- B. Windows Services  
	- C. Windows Scheduled Tasks  
	- E. Windows Registry
	- Dependent Accounts : [Manage dependent accounts | CyberArk Docs](https://docs.cyberark.com/PAS/13.0/en/Content/PASIMP/Managing-Service-Accounts.htm)
		- Dependent accounts are accounts that represent resources, such as Windows Services or Windows Scheduled Tasks. These resources or dependent accounts are accessed from a target machine and require the same credentials as the target machine. Dependent accounts may also be referred to as usages or service accounts.
		- When changing a password, the CPM synchronizes the target account password with all other occurrences of that password in any related dependent accounts.
		- The following diagram shows the procedure for how the CPM changes and synchronizes passwords in accounts on Windows services.
