A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a complete address for a website, computer, server or similar entity that exists on the internet. It provides its exact location within the domain name system (DNS) by specifying the hostname, domain name and top-level domain (TLD).

*For example, the FQDN for www.google.com is "www.google.com". The hostname is "www", the domain name is "google", and the TLD is "com"*.

FQDNs are an important part of networking because they provide a unique and unambiguous way to identify computers and resources on the internet. This helps to ensure that data is delivered to the correct destination and that security policies can be applied effectively.
