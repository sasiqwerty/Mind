The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that is used for sending datagrams over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. UDP is a simple protocol that does not guarantee delivery or order of datagrams, but it is very efficient and is often used for applications where speed is more important than reliability.

UDP is used for a variety of applications, including:

- **Streaming media:** UDP is used to stream audio and video data over the internet. This is because UDP is very efficient and can handle large amounts of data quickly.
- **Network gaming:** UDP is used for network gaming because it can provide low latency, which is important for real-time applications.
- **Domain Name System (DNS):** UDP is used to query the DNS for the IP address of a domain name.

Here are some of the key features of UDP:

- **Connectionless:** UDP does not establish a connection between two hosts before sending data.
- **Unreliable:** UDP does not guarantee that all datagrams will be delivered or that they will be delivered in the correct order.
- **Fast:** UDP is a very efficient protocol and can handle large amounts of data quickly.

UDP is a good choice for applications where speed is more important than reliability. However, it is important to be aware that UDP does not guarantee delivery or order of datagrams, so it is not suitable for all applications.

Here are some of the protocols that use UDP:

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**
- **Voice over IP (VoIP)**
- **Streaming media**
- **Network gaming**
- **Real-time messaging**
