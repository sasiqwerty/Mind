The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft Corporation which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.

By default, the server listens on [[TCP]] port 3389 and [[UDP]] port 3389

RDP works by encrypting all data that is transmitted between the client and server, including keyboard and mouse movements, screen updates, and audio. This ensures that the connection is secure and that unauthorized users cannot eavesdrop on the traffic.

RDP is a versatile protocol that can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Remote desktop access: This is the most common use for RDP. It allows users to connect to their work computers from home or from anywhere else in the world.
- Technical support: RDP can be used by technical support professionals to access a user's computer remotely in order to troubleshoot problems.
- IT management: RDP can be used by IT administrators to manage computers remotely. This includes tasks such as installing software, configuring settings, and troubleshooting problems.

- **Encryption:** All data that is transmitted between the client and server is encrypted, ensuring that the connection is secure.
- **Multi-platform support:** RDP clients and servers are available for a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.
- **Bandwidth efficient:** RDP can be used over a variety of network connections, including slow connections such as dial-up.
- **Configurable:** RDP is a highly configurable protocol, allowing users to customize the experience to their own needs.
