A domain is a logical grouping of computers and devices that share a common set of security policies. Domains are typically used to segment networks and control access to resources.

For example, a company might have a domain for its internal employees, a domain for its customers, and a domain for its partners. Each domain would have its own set of security policies, such as who is allowed to access the domain, what resources they are allowed to access, and what types of activities they are allowed to perform.

Domains can also be used to implement role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC allows administrators to assign different levels of access to different users based on their role in the organization. For example, an administrator might have full access to all domains, while a user might only have access to their own domain.

Domains are an important part of cybersecurity and networking because they help to protect networks and resources from unauthorized access. By grouping computers and devices into domains, administrators can apply security policies more easily and effectively.
