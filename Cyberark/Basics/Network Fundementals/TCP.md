The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). It is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is established between two hosts before any data is transmitted. This ensures that the data is delivered reliably and in the correct order.

TCP is used for a variety of applications, including:

- **Web browsing:** When you visit a website, your web browser uses TCP to connect to the web server.
- **Email:** When you send an email, your email client uses TCP to connect to the mail server.
- **File transfer:** When you transfer a file over the internet, your file transfer client uses TCP to connect to the server.

TCP is a reliable protocol, which means that it guarantees that all data will be delivered correctly. If any data is lost or corrupted, TCP will resend the data until it is received correctly. This makes TCP a good choice for applications where data integrity is important.

Here are some of the key features of TCP:

- **Connection-oriented:** A connection is established between two hosts before any data is transmitted.
- **Reliable:** TCP guarantees that all data will be delivered correctly.
- **Ordered:** Data is delivered in the same order in which it was sent.
- **Flow control:** TCP manages the flow of data between two hosts to prevent one host from overwhelming the other.

TCP is a complex protocol, but it is essential for many of the applications that we use every day. It is a reliable and efficient way to transmit data over the internet.

Here are some of the protocols that use TCP:

- **File Transfer Protocol ([[FTP]])**
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ([[SMTP]])**
- **Secure Shell (SSH)**
- **Telnet**
