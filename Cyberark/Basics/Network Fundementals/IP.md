  
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique address that identifies a device on a network. It is a 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) number that is written in dotted decimal notation, which is four sets of numbers separated by periods. For example, an IPv4 address might be 192.168.1.100.

IP addresses are used by devices to communicate with each other on a network. When a device sends a message to another device, it includes the IP address of the destination device in the message. The destination device then uses its IP address to route the message back to the sender.

There are two main types of IP addresses: public and private. Public IP addresses are used to identify devices on the internet. Private IP addresses are used to identify devices on a local network.

Public IP addresses are assigned by internet service providers (ISPs). When you connect to the internet, your ISP will assign you a public IP address. This address will be used to identify your device to other devices on the internet.

Private IP addresses are assigned by routers. When you connect a device to a router, the router will assign it a private IP address. This address will be used to identify your device to other devices on your local network.

You can find the IP address of your device in a number of ways. On Windows, you can open the Command Prompt and type "ipconfig". This will display a list of network adapters, including your IP address. On macOS, you can open the Network Preferences and click on the Advanced tab. This will display a list of network interfaces, including your IP address.

You can also find the IP address of your device by looking at the router configuration. The router configuration will typically list all of the devices that are connected to the router, including their IP addresses.
