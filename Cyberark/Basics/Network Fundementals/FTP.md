File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers over a network. FTP is a client-server protocol, which means that there are two components involved in the transfer: a client and a server. The client is the computer that is requesting the file, and the server is the computer that is providing the file.

FTP works by opening two connections between the client and the server: a command channel and a data channel. The command channel is used to send commands to the server, such as "list files" or "download file." The data channel is used to transfer the actual files.

FTP is a reliable protocol, which means that it guarantees that all data will be transferred correctly. If any data is lost or corrupted, FTP will resend the data until it is received correctly. This makes FTP a good choice for transferring large files or files that are critical.

Here are some of the key features of FTP:

- **Client-server protocol:** FTP is a client-server protocol, which means that there are two components involved in the transfer: a client and a server.
- **Reliable:** FTP guarantees that all data will be transferred correctly.
- **Standard protocol:** FTP is a standard protocol, which means that it is supported by most operating systems and file transfer clients.
- **Secure:** FTP can be secured using various methods, such as SSL or TLS.

FTP is a versatile protocol that can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Transferring files between computers:** FTP is the most common way to transfer files between computers over a network.
- **Mirroring files:** FTP can be used to mirror files between two computers. This means that the same files are stored on both computers.
- **Backing up files:** FTP can be used to back up files to a remote server. This is a secure way to store backups, as they are not stored on the local computer.

FTP is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of purposes. It is a reliable and standard protocol that is supported by most operating systems and file transfer clients.
