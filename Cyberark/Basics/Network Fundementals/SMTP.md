Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard network protocol used for sending electronic mail (email) across the Internet. SMTP is a client-server protocol, which means that there are two components involved in the transfer: a client and a server. The client is the computer that is sending the email, and the server is the computer that is receiving the email.

SMTP works by sending a series of commands to the server. These commands tell the server what to do with the email, such as "send the email" or "store the email." The server then executes these commands and sends the email to the recipient's inbox.

SMTP is a reliable protocol, which means that it guarantees that all email will be delivered correctly. If any email is lost or corrupted, SMTP will resend the email until it is received correctly. This makes SMTP a good choice for sending important emails.
