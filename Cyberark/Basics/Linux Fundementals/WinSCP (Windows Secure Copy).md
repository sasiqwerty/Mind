WinSCP (Windows Secure Copy) is a popular open-source file transfer application used to transfer files securely between a local computer and a remote server. It primarily runs on the Windows operating system and offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

WinSCP supports multiple protocols for secure file transfer, including:

1. Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): A secure version of FTP that encrypts data during transmission, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

2. Secure Copy Protocol (SCP): A secure remote file copy protocol that uses Secure Shell (SSH) for data transfer.

WinSCP provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface, allowing users to navigate remote file systems, upload and download files, and manage files and directories on remote servers. It offers features like drag-and-drop support, integration with PuTTY (a popular SSH client), synchronization capabilities, and the ability to edit files directly on the server using an external text editor.

WinSCP is widely used by system administrators, developers, and anyone who needs a reliable and secure method to transfer files between local and remote systems, especially in the context of managing websites, servers, and cloud-based services.
