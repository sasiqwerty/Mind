In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), a **directory service** or **name service** maps the names of network resources to their respective [network addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address "Network address"). It is a shared information infrastructure for locating, managing, administering and organizing everyday items and network resources, which can include volumes, folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers and other objects. A directory service is a critical component of a [network operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operating_system "Network operating system"). A **directory server** or [name server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server "Name server") is a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") which provides such a service. Each resource on the network is considered an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)") by the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as a collection of [attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing) "Attribute (computing)") associated with that resource or object.

A directory service defines a [namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace "Namespace") for the network. The namespace is used to assign a _name_ (unique identifier) to each of the objects. Directories typically have a set of rules determining how network resources are named and identified, which usually includes a requirement that the identifiers be [unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_identifier "Unique identifier") and [unambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unambiguous). When using a directory service, a user does not have to remember the physical address of a network resource; providing a name locates the resource. Some directory services include [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control "Access control") provisions, limiting the availability of directory information to [authorized users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization "Authorization").
