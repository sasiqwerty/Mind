An administrator is a user who has full control over the computer. They can install software, change settings, and access all files on the computer. The administrator account is the first account that is created during the Windows installation.

There are two types of administrator accounts in Windows:

- **The built-in Administrator account:** This account is disabled by default. It is a powerful account, and it should only be used by experienced users.
- **A local administrator account:** This account is created by the user during the Windows installation. It is a less powerful account than the built-in Administrator account, but it still has full control over the computer.

Administrators can create other user accounts and give them different levels of access. For example, an administrator can create a standard user account that only has access to certain files and settings.

Administrators are responsible for the security of the computer. They should make sure that the computer is up to date with the latest security patches and that the antivirus software is up to date. They should also be careful about what software they install on the computer.

If you are not an administrator, you can still ask an administrator for help. They can help you install software, change settings, and access files.
