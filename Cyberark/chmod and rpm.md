The `chmod` command is used to set or modify the permissions on files and directories in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The argument `755` specifies a particular set of permissions.

Breaking down the permissions value `755`:

- The first digit (7) refers to the owner's permissions.
- The second digit (5) refers to the group's permissions.
- The third digit (5) refers to the permissions for others.

In the octal (base-8) notation:

- A value of 4 stands for "read" (r).
- A value of 2 stands for "write" (w).
- A value of 1 stands for "execute" (x).

So, the value `7` is the sum of read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions, making it a total of 7, which implies "read, write, and execute" permissions.

For `755`, the permissions would be:

- Owner: read, write, and execute (rwx)
- Group: read and execute (r-x)
- Others: read and execute (r-x)

To apply this permission set to a file or directory, you'd use the `chmod` command followed by the permission value and the target file or directory name. For example:

```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

This command will set the permissions of "filename" so that:

- The owner can read, write, and execute the file.
- Group members and others can only read and execute it.

## RPM - Package Manager

The command you provided, `rpm -ivh`, is a command used in RPM-based Linux distributions to install a new RPM package. RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager, and it's a tool used for managing software packages in distributions like Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, and others. Let me break down the command for you:

- `rpm`: This calls the RPM package manager.
- `-i`: This flag is used to install the specified package.
- `-v`: This stands for "verbose" and, when used, provides more detailed output during the installation process.
- `-h`: This will print hash marks (#) as the installation progresses, giving you a visual indication of its progress.

To use this command, you would generally provide the name (and path, if it's not in your current directory) of an RPM package you wish to install. For instance:

```
rpm -ivh some_package.rpm
```

This would attempt to install `some_package.rpm` with verbose output and hash marks indicating progress.
