CyberArk's Privileged Threat Analytics (PTA) is designed to detect and respond to anomalous and potentially malicious activities related to privileged accounts. Here are some suspicious activities that PTA might flag:

1. **Unusual Access Times**: Accessing privileged accounts outside of regular business hours or during unusual times.
2. **Geographical Anomalies**: Login attempts from unexpected or high-risk geographical locations, especially if the user typically logs in from a different region.
3. **Frequent Login Failures**: Multiple failed login attempts in a short period, which could indicate brute force attacks.
4. **Unusual Command Execution**: Execution of commands that are not typical for the user or the role, especially system-level commands.
5. **Elevation of Privileges**: Any attempt to elevate privileges without proper authorization.
6. **Access from New Devices**: Login attempts from devices that haven't been used before with that particular privileged account.
7. **Mass Data Retrieval**: Unusual amounts of data being accessed or downloaded, which might indicate data exfiltration attempts.
8. **Password Changes**: Unexpected changes to passwords, especially for multiple accounts in a short time frame.
9. **Creation of New Privileged Accounts**: Unauthorized creation of new user accounts with elevated privileges.
10. **Disabling of Security Tools**: Attempts to disable or bypass security mechanisms, such as antivirus or intrusion detection systems.
11. **Remote Access Tools Usage**: Detection of tools commonly used for remote access or control without proper authorization.
12. **Anomalous Session Duration**: Privileged sessions that last significantly longer or shorter than typical for the user or role.
13. **Use of Clear Text Passwords**: Detection of passwords being transmitted or stored in clear text.
14. **Access to Sensitive Files or Directories**: Unauthorized access or attempts to access critical system files or directories.
15. **Simultaneous Logins**: The same privileged account being used to log in from multiple locations simultaneously.
16. **Mismatched User Behavior**: Activities that deviate significantly from the established baseline of a user's typical behavior.

These are just some examples, and the actual activities flagged would depend on the configuration, policies, and the specific environment in which CyberArk's PTA is deployed. The goal of PTA is to provide real-time insights into potential threats associated with privileged accounts, allowing organizations to respond quickly and mitigate risks.
