## Introduction

- The user with the highest [[privilege]] is the master user, when everything else fails we have to use the master user to recover the data.
- The [[PrivateArk Server|PrivateArk]] Authentication is the only way of accessing the master user.

The [[Server Central Administration Console]] shows information about login failures.

If the [[Administrator]] fails to access the account we have to use the master user to recover access to the [[Administrator]] account.

## Recovery Private Key Location

This data is located in the dbparm.ini file

Copy the complete path and paste it in the Recovery Private key location.

The [[PrivateArk Server|PrivateArk]] server will check the password and the recovery key before allowing the master user to login.

Master CD files and their contents are not stored in the server, CyberArk advices to store this data in a physical storage elsewhere.  
#important  
It is important to note that the recovery private key value is also going to accept any path, but if the master has to log in the path should be the correct one leading to the key.

CyberArk is a security solution that provides privileged access management (PAM) for organizations. Within the context of CyberArk, the "Recovery Private Key" is a critical component of the system's security infrastructure. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Purpose**: The Recovery Private Key is used to decrypt sensitive information stored within the CyberArk Vault, especially in disaster recovery scenarios. If the Vault's encryption key is lost or compromised, the Recovery Private Key can be used to restore access to the encrypted data.

2. **Generation**: During the initial setup of the CyberArk Vault, a pair of cryptographic keys is generated: a Recovery Public Key and a Recovery Private Key. The public key is used by the Vault to encrypt certain sensitive data, while the private key is used to decrypt this data.

3. **Storage**: It's crucial to store the Recovery Private Key securely, as it can provide access to all the encrypted data in the Vault if the main encryption key is unavailable. Typically, the key is stored offline in a secure location, such as a safe deposit box, and is only accessed under specific circumstances, like disaster recovery.
4. **Usage**: The Recovery Private Key is not used for day-to-day operations. Instead, it's reserved for emergency situations where the primary encryption mechanism is compromised or unavailable. For example, if there's a failure in the Vault and the main encryption key is lost, the Recovery Private Key can be used to restore access to the encrypted data.

5. **Security**: Given its importance, access to the Recovery Private Key should be highly restricted. Only a few trusted individuals within an organization should know its location and have the authority to use it.

In summary, the Recovery Private Key in CyberArk is a safeguard against data loss and provides a last-resort mechanism to access encrypted data in the Vault during emergencies. Proper management and storage of this key are essential to ensure the security of the data and the overall integrity of the CyberArk system.

## Master User Password Reset

Resetting the master password is not hard if the user already knows the old password, in the case of not having access to the master user password all hell breaks loose.
- One needs to access the support team of [[CyberArk]], pay them money and get [[ASYM]] script that checks the validity and get a temp password. Its a long process and happens in very very rare situations.

## How to Login as a Master User?

![[master-login-loc.mp3]]
1. **Master User Login Location**:
   - The Master user typically logs in to the CyberArk PrivateArk Client, which is a Windows-based client application used to manage the CyberArk Vault.
   - The PrivateArk Client connects to the Vault Server to perform various administrative tasks.

2. **Access from Any Server**:
   - By default, the Master user can only log in from the Vault Server itself for security reasons. This is to ensure that the Master user, which has the highest level of privileges, is not compromised.
   - However, CyberArk does provide a mechanism to allow the Master user to log in from remote machines, but this is not recommended for production environments due to the security risks involved. If this is enabled, the Master user can access the Vault from any server where the PrivateArk Client is installed and configured to connect to the Vault Server.

### Impersonation Error

Error: User PVWAGWUser is not allowed to impersonate User Master.

Explanation: Access to the Master is restricted to the PrivateArk Client located on the Vault or the specified emergency station. This is the reason you're unable to access through the PVWA. To log in on the Client, you must use the Master, the primary key, and the vault itself.

1. **Recommendations**:
   - It's recommended to use the Master user only for initial setup and emergency situations. For day-to-day administrative tasks, it's better to use other administrative accounts with appropriate permissions.
   - Always ensure that the Master user's credentials are stored securely and are known only to a limited number of trusted individuals.
