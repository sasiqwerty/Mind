## Server Keys

The CyberArk Vault's sophisticated encryption mechanism is designed to ensure maximum security at all times and to provide recovery capabilities, when needed.

There are two external keys associated with the server. Since these keys enable access to the server and the data stored within, it is recommended to save the server keys on a removable media, such as a disk or CD, so that they may be safely secured in a physical safe.

### Server Key

The server key opens the Vault, much like the key of a physical Vault. The key is required to start the Vault, after which the server key can be removed until the server is restarted. When the Vault is stopped, the information stored in the Vault is completely inaccessible without that key.

The path to the server key is defined in DBParm.ini.

### Recovery Key

The recovery key restores data stored in the Vault in the event that the Vault is not operational. This key should only be used in those very rare cases of failure where the Vault is not operational and cannot be repaired in the required time frame or when the key is forgotten to a Safe defined with an external key. 

The recovery key is essential for the Master User to log on to the Vault.

The recovery key is an asymmetric key composed of the public recovery key and private recovery key.

- Private recovery key  
- Public recovery key  

### Location of the Server Keys

The server key and the public recovery key are required to start the server. There are two ways of providing those keys upon start up:

Install the keys permanently on the server host. This enables you to configure the server to start automatically.

Store the keys on removable media, such as a disk or CD. After starting the server, the keys can be removed again to their safe storage.

 

It is recommended to place the keys on removable media, so they can be stored in a safe location when they are not needed.

The CyberArk Vault package consists of two folders that contain the server and recovery keys:

#### Operator

The server key and the public recovery key, which are required to start the server. These keys are used to operate the server.

#### Master

The server key, the public recovery key and the private recovery key. These keys are used for recovery and for Master logon.

## What is the Usage of the Keys come with Operator and Master CD

There are two external groups of keys associated with the Server. Since these keys enable access to the Server and the data stored within, it is recommended to save the Server keys on a removable media, such as a disk or CD, so that they may be safely secured in a physical Safe.

- Keys in the Operator CD: server.key, recpub.key, rndbase.dat
- Keys in the Master CD : server.key, recpub.key, rndbase.dat, recprv.key

  

### Server Key

The Server Key is the key used to “open” the Vault, much like the key of a physical Vault. The key is required to start the Vault, after which the Server key can be removed until the Server is restarted.  
When the Vault is stopped, the information stored in the Vault is completely inaccessible without that key. The path to the Server key is defined in DBParm.ini.  
  
Please find a definition below of the Server keys:  
  

#### Backup.Key –

This key is used to encrypt the backup sets of the Vault. The key is encrypted with the Server Key (Server.key). This is generated during installation.   
  

#### VaultUser.Pass –

This file includes an encrypted password to connect to the embedded database. It is protected and encrypted with the Server Key. This is generated during installation.   
  

#### VaultEmergency.Pass -

Is an encrypted password for emergency access to the embedded database – however, this is protected and encrypted with the Master key (RecPub.key). This is generated during installation.   
  

#### Server.pem, Server.pvk -

Are used to store the Vault certificate, and private key. The latter is encrypted with the Server Key. These are generated during the installation.   
  

#### Rndbase.dat –

This is the Random Number Generator (RNG) Seed File used by the Vault. This is provided by Cyber-Ark on the Operator CD.   
  

#### Server.key –

This is the Server key. The Server Key encrypts the Safe Keys. Each Vault Server has a different Server Key. This is provided by Cyber-Ark on the Operator CD.   
  

### Recovery Key

The Recovery Key is used to restore data stored in the Vault in the event that the Vault is not operational. This key should only be used in those very rare cases of failure where the Vault is not operational and cannot be repaired in the required time frame or when the key is forgotten to a Safe defined with an external key.  
The Recovery Key is essential for the Master User to log on to the Vault. The Recovery key is an asymmetric key composed of the Public Recovery Key (RecPub.key) and Private Recovery Key (RecPrv.key).  
  
Please find a definition below of the Recovery keys:  
  

### RecPub.key –

This is the Public Key of the RSA-2048 Asymmetric Master Key pair. It is used to encrypt the safe keys, which can then be decrypted by the Private Master Key; 

### RecPrv.key.

This is provided by CyberArk on the Operator CD  
  

### RecPrv.key -

The Private Recovery Key is required for the Master User to log on and to open the Safes in the event of Vault recovery. This Key should be stored separately from the Server in a secured place, such as on a disk or CD, in a physical vault. To recover the data that is stored in the Safe, the Private Recovery Key should be used with a recovery utility.

## About Keys

A ".key" file is a generic term used to refer to a file that contains encryption keys. Encryption keys are a crucial component of cryptographic systems, as they determine how data is encrypted and decrypted. The ".key" file extension does not specify a particular format or type of encryption, so the structure and contents of ".key" files can vary depending on the encryption algorithm and software being used.

Here are a few examples of how ".key" files might be used in different contexts:

### 1. SSL/TLS Certificates:

In the context of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols used for securing website connections, a ".key" file often refers to a file containing the private key associated with an SSL/TLS certificate. This private key is used to authenticate the identity of the server and to establish secure encrypted communication between the server and client (e.g., web browser). The corresponding public key is typically included in the SSL/TLS certificate itself.

### 2. Encryption Software:

In some encryption software or tools, a ".key" file may contain the encryption key used to encrypt or decrypt data. These files are used to safeguard sensitive information and are often protected with strong passphrases or other security measures.

### 3. Application-specific Keys:

Certain software applications may use ".key" files to store application-specific keys or credentials required for secure authentication or data protection. These keys may be used for various purposes, such as securing API access, database connections, or other sensitive information within the application.

### 4. Cryptographic Containers:

In some cases, ".key" files may not directly contain the encryption key but instead act as a container or wrapper for one or more encryption keys. These containers may also include other metadata or parameters related to the encryption process.

It's important to emphasize that ".key" files often contain sensitive information and should be handled with care. They should be properly protected and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access or misuse. Additionally, the specific usage and format of ".key" files can vary widely across different software applications and cryptographic systems. Always refer to the documentation provided by the software or technology you are using to understand the purpose and structure of a ".key" file in that context.

### Recovery Public and Private Key #gpt4

1. **Purpose**: 
   - These keys are used for the recovery of the CyberArk Digital Vault, especially in scenarios where the Master Policy is lost or compromised. The recovery process ensures that even in catastrophic situations, there's a secure way to regain access to the vault and its contents.

2. **How They Work**:
   - **Public Key**: This key is used to encrypt data. Once data is encrypted with the public key, only the corresponding private key can decrypt it.
   - **Private Key**: This key is used to decrypt data that was encrypted with its corresponding public key. It's crucial that this key remains private and secure, as anyone with access to it can decrypt sensitive data.

3. **Usage in CyberArk**:
   - During the initial setup of the CyberArk Digital Vault, a pair of recovery keys (public and private) are generated.
   - The public key remains on the server and is used by the system to encrypt certain critical data.
   - The private key should be stored securely offline (e.g., in a physical safe or secure vault). It's used for recovery purposes, so it's vital that it's kept in a place where it can't be easily accessed or compromised but can be retrieved when necessary.
   - In the event of specific failures or issues, administrators can use the private key to decrypt and recover the vault's data.

4. **Importance**:
   - The recovery keys provide a last-resort mechanism to ensure access to the vault's data, even if other security measures fail or are compromised.
   - They play a crucial role in disaster recovery scenarios, ensuring business continuity and minimizing potential downtime.

In summary, the recovery public and private keys in CyberArk provide a secure mechanism to recover the Digital Vault's data in emergency situations. Proper management, including secure storage of the private key, is essential to maintain the security and integrity of the system.
