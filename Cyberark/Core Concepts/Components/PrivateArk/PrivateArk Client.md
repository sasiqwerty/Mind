  
The PrivateArk Client is a Windows-based application that allows users to manage their privileged credentials and access the CyberArk Digital Vault. It provides a secure way to access the Digital Vault, and it also includes features for auditing and reporting.

The PrivateArk Client can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including:

- **Managing privileged credentials:** The PrivateArk Client allows users to create, view, edit, and delete privileged credentials. It also allows users to manage the permissions for privileged credentials.
- **Accessing the Digital Vault:** The PrivateArk Client allows users to access the Digital Vault to retrieve privileged credentials. It also allows users to perform administrative tasks on the Digital Vault, such as creating and managing safes.
- **Auditing and reporting:** The PrivateArk Client allows users to audit and report on privileged access activity. It provides reports on who accessed what, when, and from where.

The PrivateArk Client is a critical component of the CyberArk Privileged Access Security solution. It allows users to manage their privileged credentials securely and efficiently.

## Other Points to be noted down later
- if a file is in use, there will be an *yellow exclamation mark* over the safe that means that the files inside the safe are being accessed.
- We cannot login into [[PrivateArk Client]] and [[Password Vault Web Access]] at the same time. We have to logout of one to login into the other place.
