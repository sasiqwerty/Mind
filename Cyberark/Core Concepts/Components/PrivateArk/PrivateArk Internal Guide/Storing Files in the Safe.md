If you are working on a file that has not yet been stored in the Vault, you have several ways of copying or moving the file into the security of a Safe. 
Some Vaults and Safes require you to specify File Categories for each file that you store. This improves search capabilities in the Vault.
## Cut/Copy and Paste
You can cut or copy files into the Vault. This process is very similar to copying and pasting files from one place to another on your computer, except that instead of pasting the files to a folder on the computer, you paste it into a folder in the Safe.
Note: When you copy a file into a Safe, the original file is left on the computer, which may cause confusion between versions. In addition, the file that is left out of the Safe does not benefit from the security of the Safe.
Locate and select the files on your computer that you would like to store in the Safe. 
From the Edit menu, select Cut or Copy. 
Open the PrivateArk Client window and access the Safe where you will store the files.
In the PrivateArk Client, from the Edit menu, select Paste; the files are pasted directly into the secure environment of the Safe.
Save As
You can save files in your Windows applications in the PrivateArk Workspace, which is a virtual folder located under “My Computer” that uploads directly into the Vault.
Use Save As to navigate to the PrivateArk Workspace, and select the Safe to save your files in. When you close the Safe in the PrivateArk Client, all the files in the Workspace are automatically transferred into the Vault.
Store
You can also store files in the Safe by using the Store option.
In the Safe, display the folder the store the new file in.
From the File menu, select Store and then either Move File to Safe or Copy File to Safe.
Note:  'Move File to Safe' will delete the file from your computer, whereas 'Copy File to Safe', will leave a copy.
Select the file or files to store in the Safe, and click Open.
If you are moving files into the Safe, a confirmation box appears prompting you to confirm the Move and reminding you that the original file will be removed from the computer. Click Yes to confirm the file transfer into the Safe, or No to cancel the operation.
If you are copying files into the Safe, they are copied now.
