## Data Encryption Flow

Data Encryption flow:  
Server key=>Vault Key=>Safe key=>Object Key=> sub object key

The flow you provided indicates a cascading encryption hierarchy, which ensures that data is protected at multiple levels, from the general server environment to the specific data objects. Here's a breakdown of this encryption flow:

1. **Server Key**:
   - **Purpose**: This key ensures the foundational security of the entire server where the data resides. 
   - **Usage**: It encrypts and protects the more specific keys further down the chain. 
   - **Protection Level**: This represents the highest level of abstraction and thus the broadest level of protection. Without this key, you wouldn't be able to get to the subsequent, more granular keys.

2. **Vault Key**:
   - **Purpose**: Specific to a data vault, this key provides encryption at the vault level. 
   - **Usage**: It's responsible for encrypting the safe keys.
   - **Protection Level**: This is a more granular level of protection specific to individual data vaults. Each vault can have its unique vault key.

3. **Safe Key**:
   - **Purpose**: This key protects a 'safe' or a container within the vault. 
   - **Usage**: The safe key is used to encrypt object keys.
   - **Protection Level**: At this level, the protection becomes more specific to individual containers or safes within the vault.

4. **Object Key**:
   - **Purpose**: Objects, which can be files, credentials, or other data entities within a safe, are protected with this key.
   - **Usage**: It encrypts the actual data objects or their subsets.
   - **Protection Level**: This provides granular protection at the data object level.

5. **Sub Object Key**:
   - **Purpose**: If objects have further subdivisions or if more granular protection is required for components of an object, this key is used.
   - **Usage**: It provides encryption for sub-components of a data object.
   - **Protection Level**: This is the most detailed level of protection, ensuring that even components within a data object are encrypted and secure.

The cascade from server key down to sub object key means that to get to the most granular data (the sub-object), one would theoretically have to decrypt every prior layer. This hierarchical encryption model ensures multiple layers of security, making unauthorized decryption and data breaches increasingly difficult.

It's important to note that such a cascading encryption system would typically come with advanced key management practices to ensure the availability, integrity, and security of the keys at each level.
