Transparent connection in CyberArk is a feature that allows users to log on to target machines and websites directly from the Privileged Access Security (PAS) application. This means that users do not have to manually enter the target machine's IP address or hostname, or the website's URL. Instead, they can simply click on a link in the PAS application, and CyberArk will automatically log them on to the target machine or website.
