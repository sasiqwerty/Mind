Exclusive accounts in CyberArk are accounts that can only be used by one user at a time. This is done to prevent unauthorized access to accounts that are critical to the organization's infrastructure.

When an exclusive account is checked out, the password is changed and the account is locked. This prevents other users from accessing the account until it is checked back in.

Exclusive accounts are typically used for accounts that are used to access critical systems or data. For example, an exclusive account might be used to access a database that contains sensitive customer information.
