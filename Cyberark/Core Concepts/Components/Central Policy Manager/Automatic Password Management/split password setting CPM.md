The **Enable Split Password** setting in CyberArk allows you to split passwords into two halves, which are stored separately in the vault. This can be useful for improving security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access to entire passwords.

To enable split password mode, you need to do the following:

1. In the CyberArk Password Vault Admin Console, navigate to **Administration** > **System Configuration** > **Platform Management**.
2. Select the platform that you want to enable split password mode for.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. In the **Platform Settings** dialog box, set the **Enable Split Password** parameter to **Yes**.
5. Click **OK**.

Once you have enabled split password mode, you need to create two user groups in the vault: one for users who will be able to see the first half of the passwords, and one for users who will be able to see the second half. You can then add users to these groups as members, depending on the half of the password that they will be authorized to see.

When a user retrieves a password that is stored in split password mode, they will only be able to see the half of the password that they are authorized to see. The other half of the password will be hidden.

Here are some of the benefits of using split password mode:

- It can improve security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access to entire passwords.
- It can make it easier to manage passwords, as you only need to store half of each password in the vault.
- It can be used to implement two-factor authentication, as users need to know both halves of the password in order to log in.

## First and Second Half Group Password Setting

The **Password First Half Group** and **Password Second Half Group** password settings in CyberArk Platform Management are used to define the user groups that are authorized to see the first half and second half of passwords that are stored in split password mode.

The **Password First Half Group** setting specifies the user group that is authorized to see the first half of passwords. The **Password Second Half Group** setting specifies the user group that is authorized to see the second half of passwords.

For example, if you have a user group called `Password Admins` that is responsible for managing passwords, you could set the **Password First Half Group** setting to `Password Admins` and the **Password Second Half Group** setting to `Password Second Half Admins`. This would ensure that only members of the `Password Admins` group would be able to see the first half of passwords, and only members of the `Password Second Half Admins` group would be able to see the second half of passwords.

If you are using split password mode in CyberArk, it is important to carefully consider the **Password First Half Group** and **Password Second Half Group** settings. You should make sure that the user groups that you specify are only authorized to see the halves of passwords that they need to see. This will help to protect the security of your passwords.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the **Password First Half Group** and **Password Second Half Group** password settings:

- The user groups that you specify must already exist in the vault.
- You can specify the same user group for both the **Password First Half Group** and **Password Second Half Group** settings.
- If you do not specify a value for either setting, then all users will be authorized to see both halves of passwords.

## Use Case of Split Password Feature

The split password functionality in CyberArk can be used in a variety of use cases, including:

- **Improving security:** By splitting passwords into two halves, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to entire passwords. This is because even if an attacker were to compromise one half of a password, they would still need to obtain the other half in order to gain access to the account.
- **Making it easier to manage passwords:** Storing passwords in split password mode can make it easier to manage passwords, as you only need to store half of each password in the vault. This can save space and make it easier to find and update passwords.
- **Implementing two-factor authentication:** The split password functionality can be used to implement two-factor authentication. This is because users need to know both halves of the password in order to log in. This can add an additional layer of security to your systems.

Here are some specific examples of how the split password functionality in CyberArk can be used:

- A company that stores sensitive data in the cloud could use split password mode to store the passwords for their cloud accounts. This would help to protect the security of their data by reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the cloud accounts.
- A financial institution could use split password mode to store the passwords for their customer accounts. This would help to protect the security of their customers' data by reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the customer accounts.
- A government agency could use split password mode to store the passwords for their classified systems. This would help to protect the security of their classified data by reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the classified systems.
