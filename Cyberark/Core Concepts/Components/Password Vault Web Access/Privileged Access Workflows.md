## Introduction

Privileged Access Workflows (PAW) are a set of policies and procedures that define how privileged access is managed in an organization. PAWs typically include the following steps:

1. **Requesting access:** A user or group requests access to a privileged account.
2. **Approval:** The request is approved by an authorized individual.
3. **Provisioning:** The privileged account is provisioned and the user is given access.
4. **Monitoring:** The user's access is monitored to ensure that it is being used appropriately.
5. **Revocation:** The user's access is revoked when it is no longer needed.

PAWs can be used to improve the security of privileged access by:

- **Requiring approval for all privileged access requests:** This helps to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to privileged accounts.
- **Providing visibility into who has access to privileged accounts:** This helps to identify and mitigate risks associated with privileged access.
- **Monitoring privileged access activity:** This helps to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
- **Revoking access when it is no longer needed:** This helps to reduce the risk of privileged accounts being compromised.
