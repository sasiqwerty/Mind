AÂ platform defines shared characteristics for multiple accounts. It defines the technical settings for these accounts, such as:

- Account properties
- Credential management policies and timeframe. For example, how frequently a password will be changed or verified.
- The rules that must be applied when a new random password is generated. These rules must match the password rules on the remote machine where the password will be used, so that the password will be accepted during the password change operation as well as during log on.
- Session management. For example, how connection is established.
	- Linked accounts
	- Mail notifications
	- Workflow

[[Platform]]s can be inactive, when they are inactive they cannot be accessed hence they should be activated and used.
