Introduction to Access Control
 
Privileged accounts can be organized and stored in safes according to specific organizational requirements. Safes are entities to enable access control to privileged accounts. For example, an organization might decide to organize its accounts according to departments by creating a Safe for each department where all the accounts for that department are stored. Another option is to organize Safes by platforms e.g. Windows, UNIX, Oracle, etc. Only authorized users can view and access privileged accounts within Safes. As authorizations for each Safe group or individual members are given separately, some users will only have access to view a privileged account, while others will have access to modify its properties or change its password. Throughout the entire privileged accounts management lifecycle, the account benefits from all the security and tracking features of the Cyber-Ark Vault.
