Viewfinity, acquired by CyberArk, specializes in privilege management and application control for Windows systems. It enhances security by enforcing least privilege policies and controlling application usage. This integration extends CyberArk's capabilities in mitigating malware-based attacks, particularly at endpoints.

## Viewfinity: Key Functions

- **Least Privilege Management**: Viewfinity allows organizations to remove administrative privileges from business users. This restricts users and applications to only the privileges necessary for their specific roles and tasks, enhancing security by minimizing potential points of exploitation.
- **Application Control**: The solution enables only trusted applications to run. This significantly reduces the risk of malware infections and the progression of malware-based attacks at the endpoint level.
- **Endpoint Protection**: By focusing on endpoints, Viewfinity plays a crucial role in limiting the attacker’s ability to move beyond their initial point of entry in the network.
- **Integration with CyberArk's Solutions**: As part of CyberArk, Viewfinity's least privilege and application control solutions complement CyberArk's existing privileged account security offerings, creating a comprehensive endpoint privilege management solution.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Viewfinity offers both SaaS-based and on-premise deployment options, providing flexibility to organizations depending on their specific infrastructure and security needs.
- **Comprehensive Security Coverage**: With this acquisition, CyberArk extends its privileged account security solutions to cover vulnerabilities throughout an organization’s IT infrastructure, including both deep network elements and end-user devices.
- **Enhanced Detection and Forensics**: Viewfinity operates with a single agent on the endpoint, utilizing a kernel-based architecture that offers advanced forensics and detection capabilities.
- **Customizable Deployment Options**: The solution offers various deployment strategies, allowing organizations to select the most effective approach to streamline deployment and reduce costs.
