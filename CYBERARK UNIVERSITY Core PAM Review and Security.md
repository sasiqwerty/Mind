## Enterprise Password Vault Solution Overview

The infographic provides an in-depth overview of the **Enterprise Password Vault Solution**, emphasizing its components, processes, and integrations. Below is a tabulated summary:

| **Component/Step**                 | **Description**                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Master/exception policy definition** | Establishing a primary policy that dictates password behaviors with exceptions for specific cases.                        |
| **2. Initial load & reset**       | - The initial setup and potential reset of the system.<br> - Options for account discovery, bulk upload, and manual methods are presented. |
| **3. Request workflow**           | - Incorporates dual control for enhanced security.<br> - Integrates with ticketing systems.<br> - Features such as one-time passwords, exclusivity, and more. |
| **4. PSM connection to device**   | Establishing a secure connection between the Password Vault (PSM) and the intended device.                               |
| **5. Auditor access**             | Facilitating access for auditors to inspect and review the vault operations.                                             |
| **CyberArk**                      | A central component that seems to be the primary software/system in use for this solution.                               |
| **CPM (Master Policy)**           | Central Policy Manager that governs the password behaviors and rules.                                                    |
| **EPV**                           | Enterprise Password Vault, likely where passwords are stored securely.                                                    |
| **PWA**                           | Possibly a web access portal to manage and access the vault.                                                            |
| **System-User-Password Matrix**   | Tabulated data showing systems (Unix, Oracle, etc.), their corresponding user accounts, and respective password samples. |

The infographic visually represents the flow of data and processes:

- IT and Security/Risk Management define policies and handle the initial setup.
- These policies are stored in **EPV** and managed by **CPM**.
- **PWA** appears to be an interface for requesting access to specific systems, like the Windows Administrator in the given example.
- Access requests are passed through the **PSM**, which interfaces with the actual **Enterprise IT Environment** to facilitate the access using the vaulted passwords.
- Auditors can request to view reports, likely for compliance and audit purposes.

In essence, the infographic outlines an enterprise solution for secure password management, ensuring that access to systems is controlled, monitored, and compliant with organizational policies.
