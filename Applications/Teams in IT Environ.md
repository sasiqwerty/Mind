In real-life production IT environments, various teams collaborate to design, implement, and maintain complex systems. The specific teams can vary based on the company's size, industry, and focus, but here is a broad outline of the teams you might find:

1. **Infrastructure/Operations Team**: This team manages the IT infrastructure, which includes servers, storage, networking equipment, and data centers. Their responsibilities also often cover cloud resources, if the company uses cloud services.

2. **DevOps/Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team**: Blending software development and IT operations, this team ensures that software can be reliably deployed to production and maintains its stability. They work closely with developers and use automation tools and practices.

3. **Development/Engineering Team**: This team writes the actual software applications. Depending on the company, it could be further broken down into:
   - Frontend Development
   - Backend Development
   - Full Stack Development
   - Mobile Development

4. **Quality Assurance (QA) / Testing Team**: This team tests the software written by the development team to find and report bugs. They ensure that the software meets quality standards before it's released to the end-users.

5. **Database Administration Team**: These are the specialists who design, implement, maintain, and optimize databases. They ensure data consistency, integrity, and availability.

6. **Network Team**: This team ensures that all parts of the companyâ€™s IT systems can communicate with each other and the outside world efficiently and securely.

7. **Security/InfoSec Team**: They protect the company's IT assets from threats, both internal and external. This team deals with things like penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, security audits, and more.

8. **Product Management Team**: These people decide what features the software should have. They represent the business side of things and work closely with the development and QA teams.

9. **Support/Help Desk Team**: They provide technical support to end-users. This could be internal support for employees or external support for customers, depending on the nature of the software.

10. **Release Management Team**: They coordinate the release of new software versions, ensuring that everything goes smoothly when a new version is deployed.

11. **Business Analysis/Requirements Team**: They gather and define the business requirements that the software needs to meet. These requirements are then passed to the development and QA teams to build and test the software.

12. **UI/UX Design Team**: These professionals work on the user interface and the overall user experience of the software, ensuring that it's intuitive and user-friendly.

13. **Data Science/Analytics Team**: Especially in companies that leverage big data, this team works on data modeling, predictive analysis, and other related tasks.

14. **Project Management/Scrum Masters**: They oversee projects, coordinate different teams, and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. 

15. **Compliance and Audit Team**: In some industries, especially regulated ones, there's a need for dedicated teams to ensure that IT practices comply with laws and regulations.
